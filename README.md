# P1---Sastantua
First python project I realized. Its goal was to create the pyramid of sastantua in console mode with python, using elementary elements of the python language.

The size of the pyramid is set in the file. I didn't exactly follow the rules in the PDF, the idea was just to train in algorithm conception and use the python langage. I did my best to make it as configurable as possible. So, in a few months, if the width of the door, or the number of stars per stage, ..., has to be changed, it will be easily adaptable. The main rules are mentionned at the top of the python file.

Finally, I have to specify that the main original is taken from the 42 POOL.
